This is a simple jwt authentication service. I've implemented the basic functionalities like creating a token, verifying it and refreshing
the token after certain interval to enhance the security. This can be used to protect the routes you want.

WHY IS A TOKEN NEEDED??

WHAT IS JWT AND WHY IS IT PREFERED?
                                   
HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT?


Any Questions/Suggestions?
